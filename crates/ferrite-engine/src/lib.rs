//! `BrowserEngine`: the full agentic browser action surface
//! (`docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` §6/A9, T-109), and this crate's own
//! [`MockEngine`] — deterministic, no feature flag, always built, backing
//! every test in the workspace that needs a `BrowserEngine`.
//!
//! The real embedding, `ServoEngine` (wrapping
//! `ferrite_servo::session::HeadlessServoSession`), lives in the sibling
//! `ferrite-engine-servo` crate behind the `engine-servo` Cargo feature —
//! kept out of this crate entirely so the default build, and every test that
//! does not need a live Servo, never pulls in `libservo`'s dependency tree
//! (directive §7.1: "not building Servo for 95% of the work" is the single
//! biggest build/disk lever).
//!
//! # Origin tracking is unavoidable, not optional
//!
//! Every action method returns `Result<(T, Origin), EngineError>` rather
//! than `T` alone. The origin the action executed against travels with the
//! result, so a caller (the dry-run recorder, a future live executor) can
//! never forget to separately query it after the fact — this is the
//! directive's own stated reason for the shape, not a convenience.
//!
//! Actions are also tagged, internally, with the
//! [`ferrite_core::Primitive`] they realize (see [`Call::primitive`]) —
//! reusing A2's closed wire vocabulary rather than inventing a second,
//! independent tool-id string the way the pre-rebuild `BrowserTool::tool_id`
//! and `Primitive::as_str()` once drifted apart on exactly one case
//! (T-216). There is deliberately no second vocabulary here to drift.
//!
//! # Opaque origins are a real, first-class error, not a panic
//!
//! `ferrite_core::Origin` only represents `http`/`https` origins (ADR-004,
//! ratified at T-211): every other scheme is opaque and, by construction, no
//! [`OriginScope`](ferrite_core::OriginScope) can ever admit it. A page whose
//! current URL has an opaque scheme (`about:blank`, a `data:` URL, a `blob:`
//! URL) genuinely has no `Origin` to report. Rather than fabricate one, every
//! `BrowserEngine` action attempted while the active page has no
//! representable origin fails with [`EngineError::OpaqueOrigin`] — a real,
//! observable outcome a caller can route to consent the same way T-211's
//! comparator already treats an unparseable recorded origin.
//!
//! [`MockEngine`] never actually hits this in practice for a caller who only
//! navigates to `http`/`https` URLs (its very first tab starts at a
//! synthetic-but-representable `https://mock-home.ferrite.test` placeholder,
//! specifically so a fresh engine still has *something* real to report —
//! unlike a real browser's `about:blank`). A test can still exercise the
//! opaque-origin path deliberately by navigating `MockEngine` to a `data:`
//! or other non-http(s) URL. `ServoEngine`, by contrast, genuinely starts
//! on `about:blank` and hits this path for real before the first navigation.
//!
//! # `js_execute` is privileged
//!
//! `js_execute` exists on this trait because *something* has to run the
//! model's arbitrary-script requests, but its existence here is not a safety
//! claim. `ferrite-ipi`'s comparator treats every `js.execute` primitive as
//! an unconditional deviation, at any scope, regardless of origin (ADR-003)
//! — that gating happens upstream of whatever calls this trait. A caller
//! that invokes [`BrowserEngine::js_execute`] directly, with no
//! comparator/consent step in front of it, has bypassed that job, not this
//! trait's: this method is not the safety net, it is the thing the safety
//! net watches.
