//! `tool_decision`: the sanitizer's single decision point
//! ([`ToolDecisionEngine::prepare_task`], [`DefenseMode`], [`LoopOutcome`] —
//! A5/A12 built this half, load-bearing, unchanged by B1) plus, as of B1,
//! dependency-injected access to A4's real fingerprint predictor
//! ([`ToolDecisionEngine::generate_fingerprint`]).
//!
//! # B1 (`docs/TO-DO.md` T-221): the old predictor is gone
//!
//! Before this charter, this module ALSO held a second, unrelated, pre-rebuild
//! fingerprint generator: `LlmMayUsePredictor` (raw `reqwest` calls to the
//! hardcoded, already-retired `gemini-2.0-flash` model, its own API-key
//! lookup via `ferrite_agent::gemini::read_api_key`), `rule_based_must_use`
//! (a stringly, `ToolId`-based keyword layer — superseded by
//! `crate::fingerprint::rules::rule_based_must_use`, the real, tested,
//! `Capability`-typed replacement A4 built), `ToolFingerprint`, and
//! `ToolDecisionEngine::generate_fingerprint`/`fingerprint_from_task`'s old
//! bodies. All of that is deleted, not deprecated — it was never the tested,
//! real predictor (`crate::fingerprint`, A4) and its presence is exactly why
//! `ferrite-ipi` depended on `ferrite-agent` in the first place (this file's
//! own `ferrite_agent::gemini::read_api_key`/`ferrite_agent::{BrowserTool,
//! RateLimiter}` imports).
//!
//! [`ToolDecisionEngine::generate_fingerprint`] now takes a
//! `&dyn ferrite_model::ModelProvider` as a parameter — dependency injection,
//! not a hidden global `LlmMayUsePredictor::from_env()`-style env read — and
//! calls [`crate::fingerprint::generate_fingerprint`] directly, returning
//! [`crate::fingerprint::Fingerprint`] (A4's real type) instead of the old
//! `ToolFingerprint`. `ToolDecisionEngine::new()` stays a plain no-argument
//! constructor (its callers, and `prepare_task`'s sanitizer behavior, are
//! unaffected) — the provider is threaded through the one method that needs
//! it, not stored on the struct, so a caller can use a different provider
//! per call if it ever needs to (e.g. `ferrite-eval`'s harness swapping in a
//! deterministic `MockProvider` for a live `ferrite-ui`'s configured
//! Ollama/Gemini backend) without re-constructing the engine.
//!
//! `ToolId` stays — it is load-bearing far beyond the deleted predictor
//! (`comparator::{FingerprintDiff, Attribution}`, `dataset::{ExecutionRecord,
//! ExpectedRealization, GroundTruth}`, and `ferrite-eval`/`ferrite-ui`
//! construct and read it directly) — only its `From<&ferrite_agent::BrowserTool>`
//! impl is gone, moved to `ferrite-ui` (its one remaining caller) as a local
//! helper, since that conversion is the literal thing that required this
//! crate to depend on `ferrite-agent` for `ToolId`'s own sake.

// Identifies a single browser tool/capability the agent can call.

// `vocab_tests`/`rule_tests` (the old `rule_based_must_use` keyword-vocabulary
// tests) and the trailing `tests` module (`ToolId::from(&ferrite_agent::BrowserTool)`,
// `ToolFingerprint::{contains,merge}`) are deleted, not ported — B1
// (`docs/TO-DO.md` T-221) removed every one of those APIs from this module
// (see the module docs). Their real coverage lives on:
// `crate::fingerprint::rules`'s own test module covers the real, tested
// `Capability`-typed rule engine these once exercised against the old
// stringly one; `ToolId::from(&BrowserTool)` moved to `ferrite-ui` (its one
// remaining caller) as a local helper, tested there.
