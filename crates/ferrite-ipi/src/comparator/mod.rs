//! The comparator: what the agent actually did, compared against what its
//! task said it might need (`docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` §6/A7, "the
//! highest-value fix in the rebuild").
//!
//! This module replaces the old flat `comparator.rs`, whose `compare()` took
//! **one** `OriginScope` for the whole task — a signature that could not
//! express a fingerprint mixing a narrow `scoped.read` on `mail.example.com`
//! with a wide `web.read` for open search results (D1/T-001), and that left
//! `OriginScope::admission_rank()` computed and never consumed (D2/T-002).
//! The old file's local `OriginScope`/`ScopeType` types are gone; every type
//! this module's `compare` reasons about origin-scoping with is
//! [`ferrite_core::scope::OriginScope`]/[`ferrite_core::scope::Specificity`].
//!
//! # New contract
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn compare(expected: &ExpectedFingerprint, actual: &DryRunRecord) -> FingerprintDiff;
//! ```
//!
//! [`ExpectedFingerprint`] wraps [`ferrite_core::ExpectedCapabilitySet`] —
//! capabilities, each carrying its **own** [`ferrite_core::scope::OriginScope`] —
//! which is already exactly the shape the directive asks for (A2 built it;
//! see [`expected`]'s docs for how a live task's fingerprint gets one today).
//!
//! # Where a per-capability `OriginScope` comes from — the design gap
//!
//! This is the single most important design decision in this charter, so it
//! is spelled out here at length rather than in a commit message no one
//! reads later.
//!
//! Two fingerprint types exist in this crate today, and **neither** carries
//! a per-capability scope:
//!
//! - `fingerprint::Fingerprint` (A4): `must_use`/`may_use` are
//!   `BTreeSet<Capability>` — no scope field at all. A4's own module docs
//!   say so explicitly: an authored `OriginScope` per capability "isn't
//!   derivable from a prompt... left for A7's comparator integration."
//! - `tool_decision::ToolFingerprint` (pre-rebuild, still the live path for
//!   `ferrite-ui` and `ferrite-eval::harness`): stringly `ToolId` sets, also
//!   no scope.
//!
//! Meanwhile every *caller* of the old `compare()` already had exactly
//! **one** `OriginScope` to give it — `dataset::CaseDefinition::expected_origins`
//! for the eval harness, or a hardcoded `OriginScope::task_open()` in
//! `ferrite-ui` (see that call site's own `TODO(Task 19)` comment, now
//! resolved — read on). So the gap is not "no scope exists anywhere"; it is
//! "no one authors a *different* scope per capability yet — only ever one
//! per task."
//!
//! Resolution chosen (option (a) from the A7 charter): [`ExpectedFingerprint`]
//! provides two *bridging* constructors —
//! [`ExpectedFingerprint::from_fingerprint`] and
//! [`ExpectedFingerprint::from_legacy_tool_fingerprint`] — that apply a
//! single scope to every capability in a fingerprint that has none of its
//! own, sourced from the one piece of context a live task actually carries:
//! its declared context URL (`exact([context_url])` when present,
//! `task_open` with a stated rationale when it is not). Both constructors'
//! doc comments spell out the policy and its honesty limits in full,
//! **and are explicitly named "provisional"** in their own scope rationale
//! text — this is a stand-in for a real per-task authoring mechanism that
//! does not exist yet, not a claim that per-capability precision has been
//! achieved. [`ExpectedFingerprint::from_capabilities`] is the direct,
//! no-defaulting constructor for any caller — present or future — that
//! *does* have a genuine per-capability scope to give, which is what makes
//! this a real fix rather than a relabeled global scope: the type can
//! express per-capability precision the moment something upstream starts
//! authoring it, without another comparator rewrite.
//!
//! **The regression this must never collapse into**: defaulting every
//! capability to `task_open` unconditionally, which would readmit every
//! origin and make the whole T-001 rewrite pointless. This is why
//! `from_fingerprint` only reaches `task_open` when there is *no* context
//! URL — see `expected::tests::from_fingerprint_with_a_context_url_still_flags_a_different_origin`,
//! which is written to fail specifically if that default were ever widened.
//! The live `ferrite-ui` call site (`crates/ferrite-ui/src/lib.rs`) is a
//! second instance of exactly this fix: it already threads the active tab's
//! URL into `AgentTask::context_url`, but its old `compare()` call ignored
//! that and hardcoded `OriginScope::task_open()` — a real instance of "just
//! default to TaskOpen" already living in production. This session's
//! minimal edit to that call site passes the task's own `context_url`
//! through `from_fingerprint`'s bridge instead, so the live path gets real
//! origin narrowing for free rather than staying an open TODO.
//!
//! # `js.execute` — unconditional, first branch, no exceptions (ADR-003)
//!
//! `compare`'s very first check on every event is whether its primitive's
//! [`ferrite_core::ActionClass`] is scopable at all
//! (`ActionClass::is_scopable`). `js.execute` is the one primitive whose
//! class is not, and that check runs *before* any origin is even parsed —
//! so there is no origin, however permissively scoped, that can ever reach
//! the attribution logic for it. `tests::js_execute_is_flagged_even_under_a_scope_that_would_admit_any_origin`
//! is the test that proves the "no exceptions" rule really has none in this
//! code, not just in the ones that were convenient to write.
//!
//! # Attribution and the T-206 double-flag fix
//!
//! For each recorded event whose primitive *is* scopable and whose origin
//! *does* parse as a real [`ferrite_core::Origin`]:
//!
//! 1. Every `(primitive, scope, capability)` triple from
//!    [`ExpectedFingerprint::lowered`] whose primitive matches is a
//!    candidate.
//! 2. Among candidates, `scope.admits(origin)` is called — this is the exact
//!    call D2/T-002 was about: [`ferrite_core::scope::Specificity`]'s `Ord`
//!    is the admission rank, and `compare` picks the candidate with the
//!    *maximum* one (`exact > domain_suffix > task_open`), recording which
//!    capability that was in [`Attribution`]. `tests::admission_rank_is_actually_consumed_not_just_computed`
//!    is written so that reverting to "first match wins" instead of "highest
//!    rank wins" fails it.
//! 3. If no candidate admits the origin: was the primitive a candidate at
//!    all (some capability names it, just not at this origin)? If so, this
//!    is an **`OutOfScopeOrigin`** — the origin string goes into
//!    `out_of_scope_origins`. If *no* capability's realization ever
//!    contained the primitive, this is an **`ExtraPrimitive`** — the tool id
//!    goes into `extra_primitives`.
//!
//! Step 3 is deliberately an `if`/`else`, not two independent checks — this
//! is the T-206 fix. The old `compare()` checked "is the origin admitted?"
//! and, independently, "is the primitive in the flat expected union?",
//! which could set *both* `out_of_scope_origins` and `extra_primitives` for
//! the same event when both questions answered "no". Here, "primitive named
//! by some capability" and "primitive named by no capability" partition the
//! primitive space **exactly** — a primitive is in exactly one of those two
//! states with respect to the whole expected set, independent of any
//! origin — so the two outcomes are mutually exclusive by construction, not
//! by remembering not to double-insert. `tests::t206_regression_primitive_not_expected_and_origin_not_admitted_lands_in_exactly_one_bucket`
//! is the direct regression test.
//!
//! **Why there is no `Both` variant.** The charter asks whether `Both`
//! should exist as a third classification. Having built the fix, the answer
//! is no: `Both` would only ever fire for the exact case T-206 already
//! names — a primitive nobody expects, at an origin nobody admits — and
//! that is fully and correctly described by `ExtraPrimitive` alone (the
//! primitive being unexpected is already sufficient reason to flag it; the
//! origin question is moot once no capability could have admitted the
//! primitive in the first place, at any origin). Introducing `Both` would
//! either (a) duplicate information already implied by `ExtraPrimitive`, or
//! (b) resurrect the double-counting bug under a new name by trying to
//! independently populate two buckets for one event. The classification
//! this module implements is a true partition of "successfully attributed /
//! out-of-scope-origin / extra-primitive" with no overlap, which is the
//! stronger property.
//!
//! # T-211 — opaque and missing origins: ratified, not left open
//!
//! `ferrite_core::ids::Origin::parse` accepts only `http`/`https` by design
//! — its own doc comment states plainly that every other scheme has an
//! *opaque* origin, "which by definition no scope can admit", so admitting
//! one into `Origin` "would be modelling something the scope algebra cannot
//! express." Having read that reasoning together with ADR-004 and A6's
//! handoff, this session **ratifies** that stance rather than adding a
//! `ferrite_core::ids::Origin::Opaque` variant: a variant would have to be
//! unconditionally unadmittable by every `OriginScope` construction to mean
//! anything, which is exactly what "fails to parse, therefore unadmittable"
//! already achieves today, with strictly less surface area (no new match
//! arm every future `OriginScope`/`Origin` consumer has to remember to
//! handle correctly). `compare` treats the two cases A6 flagged explicitly:
//!
//! - An origin string that was recorded but does not parse as `http`/`https`
//!   (`about:blank`, `data:...`, `blob:...`) goes into
//!   `out_of_scope_origins` under its literal string — there *is* a
//!   reportable origin, it is simply one nothing can ever admit, which reads
//!   naturally as "this origin is out of scope" to a consent reviewer.
//! - An event with **no** recorded origin at all (`ToolEvent.origin ==
//!   None`, e.g. an action before the first navigation) has nothing to
//!   report as an offending origin, so it is classified as an
//!   `extra_primitives` entry instead — the same bucket `js.execute` and
//!   `Origin::parse` failures on the primitive side land in, i.e. "cannot
//!   ever be justified", which is the honest description of an action taken
//!   with no origin context to check against any scope.
//!
//! `docs/TO-DO.md`'s T-211 row is updated to `done` (ratified), not left as
//! an open design question.
//!
//! # T-216 — `download.file` vs. `Primitive::Download`
//!
//! `ferrite-agent::BrowserTool::DownloadFile::tool_id()` emits the wire
//! string `"download.file"`; `ferrite_core::Primitive::Download::as_str()`
//! is `"download"` (no dot-suffix) — a pre-existing mismatch
//! `dry_run::record::ToolEvent::primitive()` already documents and returns
//! `None` for. Two ways to fix it were weighed:
//!
//! - Change `BrowserTool::tool_id()`'s string. Rejected: that string is key
//!   material for `dry_run::content::DryRunContent::by_tool_id` (a case
//!   author's per-tool reply queues are keyed on it), and is also embedded
//!   literally in `ferrite-eval`'s corpus fixtures/tests
//!   (`crates/ferrite-eval/src/corpus.rs`, `crates/ferrite-eval/tests/pilot_w6.rs`).
//!   Changing it would ripple into `dry_run/content.rs` (A6's off-limits
//!   file) and multiple `ferrite-eval` fixtures for a fix that belongs to
//!   this module alone.
//! - Add an explicit mapping in this module, scoped to exactly the one known
//!   mismatch. Chosen: [`resolve_primitive`] tries
//!   `ToolEvent::primitive()` first and falls back to a one-entry match for
//!   `"download.file"` → [`ferrite_core::Primitive::Download`] only when
//!   that bridge returns [`None`]. This is strictly additive, touches
//!   nothing outside `comparator/`, and is exactly as honest about scope as
//!   the mismatch itself (one string, one primitive).
//!
//! `docs/TO-DO.md`'s T-216 row is updated to `done`.
//!
//! # How far this actually reaches
//!
//! - `attributions` records the admitting capability and specificity per
//!   successfully-justified event, in recorded order — the shape A8's audit
//!   log needs to cite "which capability justified this" per entry, not
//!   just "something did". It is **not** deduplicated: a repeated
//!   tool/origin pair produces a repeated `Attribution`, one per actual
//!   occurrence, because the audit log's job is recording what happened,
//!   not summarizing it.
//! - `compare` has no notion of *time* beyond the order `actual.tool_events`
//!   already carries — it does not re-derive `events_with_seq`. A future
//!   caller that needs "attribute event N specifically" rather than "was
//!   this tool/origin pair ever justified" would zip `attributions` back
//!   against `events_with_seq()` by matching tool+origin, which is unambiguous only
//!   as long as duplicate calls to the same tool/origin are attributed
//!   identically — true here, since attribution depends only on
//!   `(primitive, origin)`, never on call order.
//! - `extra_primitives`/`out_of_scope_origins` remain `HashSet`s (pre-rebuild
//!   shape, kept for `dataset`/`ferrite-eval`/`ferrite-ui` compatibility —
//!   see `diff`'s module docs), so a diff answers "was tool X ever flagged"
//!   and "was origin Y ever out of scope", not "on which of N calls". The
//!   ordered `attributions` list is the only place call-level granularity
//!   survives.
