//! [`DryRunEngine`]: the dry run's synthetic [`ferrite_engine::BrowserEngine`]
//! implementation — the core deliverable of `docs/TO-DO.md` T-221 (B1).
//!
//! # The architectural decision, in full (why `BrowserEngine`, why a new
//! type rather than `MockEngine`, and why not `browser_loop`)
//!
//! Before this charter, the dry run was a bespoke system:
//! `RecordingExecutor` implemented `ferrite_agent::ToolExecutor`, driven by
//! whatever `ferrite_agent::AgentRuntime` the caller supplied, dispatching on
//! `ferrite_agent::BrowserTool` — a vocabulary independent of, and
//! occasionally inconsistent with (T-216), `ferrite_core::Primitive`. That
//! coupling to `ferrite-agent` is exactly `docs/TO-DO.md` T-221: `ferrite-ipi`
//! depended on `ferrite-agent`, backwards from the target dependency
//! direction (`core ← {model, audit, engine} ← ipi ← agent ← {ui, eval,
//! cli}`, `CLAUDE.md`).
//!
//! `ferrite_engine::BrowserEngine` (A9) already solves almost exactly the
//! problem the dry run has — a full agentic-browser action surface, every
//! method tagged with a real `ferrite_core::Primitive`
//! ([`ferrite_engine::Call::primitive`]) and returning `(T, Origin)` — but
//! for a different original purpose (the *production* agent loop's
//! engine-agnostic backing). Two shapes were weighed for how the dry run
//! should relate to it:
//!
//! **(A) Unify under `ferrite_agent::browser_loop::run_agent_loop`.**
//! `run_agent_loop` is already provider-agnostic and engine-agnostic
//! (`&dyn ModelProvider`, `&mut dyn BrowserEngine`) — feeding it a
//! synthetic, scripted `BrowserEngine` would functionally reproduce "drive
//! the agent's real plan against fake data," and would be the
//! architecturally cleanest end state: one action vocabulary, one agent
//! loop, for both dry-run and live execution.
//!
//! This was **rejected for this charter**, for a structural reason, not a
//! taste preference: `run_agent_loop` — and its `AgentAction` vocabulary,
//! system prompt, and JSON-action-per-turn protocol — lives in
//! `crates/ferrite-agent/src/browser_loop.rs`. Depending on it from
//! `ferrite-ipi`, even only on that one function, is still a `ferrite-ipi →
//! ferrite-agent` edge — exactly the backwards direction T-221 names,
//! regardless of which part of `ferrite-agent` is depended on. Closing T-221
//! this way would require relocating `run_agent_loop` (or the whole
//! `browser_loop` module) out of `ferrite-agent` into a crate both `ipi` and
//! `agent` can depend on — real, cross-crate surgery on a module this
//! charter's file list does not include, and squarely the kind of change the
//! charter asks to be described and handed off rather than attempted under a
//! different review scope. It is also unnecessary to get T-221's actual
//! benefit: the dry run does not need the *model* to decide the plan the way
//! `run_agent_loop` does (a live agent, or `ferrite-eval`'s
//! `WorstCaseAgent`, already decides the plan upstream) — it needs a place
//! to *execute* that plan against synthetic data, which is a narrower
//! requirement.
//!
//! **(B) `ferrite-ipi::dry_run` grows its own `BrowserEngine`-implementing
//! type, with its own (small) orchestration loop, separate from
//! `browser_loop`.** This is what this module does. `DryRunEngine` below
//! implements `ferrite_engine::BrowserEngine` directly, reusing
//! [`content::DryRunContent`]'s per-origin ordered reply-queue *pattern*
//! (A6, preserved verbatim — see that module's docs) without depending on
//! `ferrite_engine::MockEngine` (which exists to back *tests*, not to be a
//! production dependency of this crate's own synthetic-execution path — see
//! `ferrite_engine`'s own module docs on why `MockEngine` is unconditionally
//! built rather than gated, which does not make it the right type for this
//! crate to build on rather than pattern-match).
//!
//! `DryRunOrchestrator::run` is generic over a small local trait,
//! [`super::orchestrator::DryRunDriver`], rather than
//! `ferrite_agent::AgentRuntime` — "whatever decides the plan" now drives a
//! `&mut DryRunEngine` directly (calling `navigate`/`dom_snapshot`/`click`/…
//! the same way a live caller would drive any other `BrowserEngine`), instead
//! of constructing `ferrite_agent::AgentToolCall`s for a `ToolExecutor` to
//! interpret. A caller that still has an existing `ferrite_agent::AgentRuntime`
//! (a live `GeminiAgent`, or `ferrite-eval`'s `WorstCaseAgent`) bridges it
//! with the small, purely additive `ferrite_agent::engine_bridge::EngineToolExecutor`
//! adapter this charter added to `ferrite-agent` (which already depends on
//! `ferrite_engine` for `browser_loop` — no new dependency edge there) —
//! see `docs/handoffs/b01.md` for exactly how `ferrite-eval`/`ferrite-ui`
//! use it.
//!
//! **The real trade-off of (B) — stated plainly, not hidden.** A seam
//! remains between "how dry-runs execute a plan" (this module) and "how the
//! live agent loop executes a plan" (`browser_loop::run_agent_loop`,
//! untouched). They now share the *action* vocabulary
//! (`ferrite_engine::BrowserEngine`/`Primitive`) — the actual goal of T-221
//! — but not one call-site's worth of orchestration code. Given this
//! charter's mandate ("this is the highest-risk charter... a partial,
//! honestly-reported result is far better than a broken merge") and the
//! explicit instruction not to preempt B2's `ferrite-eval` migration or
//! touch `ferrite-ui`/`ferrite-shell`, (B) is the version of "no old stuff"
//! this session can responsibly deliver: it removes the *backwards
//! dependency* (T-221's literal defect) and the *vocabulary mismatch*
//! (T-216's literal defect) without forcing a same-session rewrite of every
//! downstream consumer's own orchestration loop. Fully collapsing the seam
//! — adopting `browser_loop::run_agent_loop` everywhere, live and dry-run
//! alike — is a legitimate future direction, but it is B2/B3's call once
//! `ferrite-eval`/`ferrite-ui` are themselves migrated onto the new
//! vocabulary, not something to force from `ferrite-ipi`'s side alone.
//!
//! # Content scripting: two independent lookup keys, on purpose
//!
//! [`content::DryRunContent`]'s public shape (`read_page`, `extract_data`,
//! `by_tool_id`) is **unchanged** by this module — `ferrite-eval::corpus`'s
//! JSON-corpus loader (`crates/ferrite-eval/src/corpus.rs::lower_content`)
//! constructs it directly by field/method name.
//!
//! **B2 update (`docs/TO-DO.md` T-221):** [`content_key_for_call`]'s keys
//! were originally the pre-existing `ferrite_agent::BrowserTool::tool_id()`
//! strings (`"navigate"`, `"dom.write"`, `"clipboard.read"`,
//! `"download.file"`, …), kept that way purely so `ferrite-eval::corpus`'s
//! JSON scripting kept working unmodified while B1 removed `ferrite-ipi`'s
//! backwards dependency on `ferrite-agent`. B2 (which owns `ferrite-eval`'s
//! own migration off that vocabulary — see `docs/handoffs/b01.md`/`b02.md`)
//! retyped both sides together: `content_key_for_call` now returns
//! `ferrite_core::Primitive::as_str()` directly (so `Call::Download` keys on
//! `"download"`, not `"download.file"`, and `Call::Click` gets its own
//! `"click"` key distinct from `Call::TypeText`/`Call::SelectOption`'s
//! `"dom.write"` — a real primitive distinction the old merged key hid),
//! and `ferrite-eval::corpus`'s `by_tool` validation now derives its known-ID
//! set from `Primitive::ALL` the same way. Verified low-risk before making
//! this change: at B2 time, the entire 29-case corpus had exactly one
//! `by_tool`-scripted case (`ref06_t1b_jsonfield_exfil.json`, using
//! `"download.file"`), migrated to `"download"` in the same commit — no
//! other fixture's scripted content silently stopped resolving.
//!
//! So there are deliberately **two** independent identifiers for one
//! `BrowserEngine` call, serving two different, non-overlapping purposes:
//! - [`ToolEvent::primitive`](super::record::ToolEvent) — the real,
//!   direct `ferrite_core::Primitive` `compare()` reasons about. Always
//!   correct, always derived from [`ferrite_engine::Call::primitive`], never
//!   a lookup into anything a case author wrote.
//! - [`content_key_for_call`] (this module, private) — which
//!   `content.by_tool_id` bucket a case author's *content* lands in. Since
//!   B2 this is the same `Primitive::as_str()` string `ToolEvent::primitive`
//!   would carry for that call, but it remains a structurally separate
//!   lookup, not a shared implementation: it derives its key from the
//!   `ferrite_engine::Call` shape (a case author's authoring-time construct)
//!   rather than from the primitive the engine ends up recording, and it has
//!   **no** security role — get it "wrong" (or miss a new `BrowserEngine`
//!   action, e.g. `scroll`, `wait_for`, `tab.open` — T-230, not extended by
//!   B2 since no corpus case exercises them) and the dry run simply falls
//!   through to a generic synthetic stub reply for that call, exactly as an
//!   unscripted call already does today. This is categorically different
//!   from the T-216 bridge it replaces, which fed a security-relevant
//!   classification (`compare()`'s primitive matching) — a wrong answer
//!   there could hide a real deviation. A wrong answer here can only
//!   under-script a synthetic reply.
