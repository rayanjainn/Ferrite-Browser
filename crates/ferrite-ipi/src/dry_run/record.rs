//! The dry-run event log: [`ToolEvent`], [`DryRunRecord`], and the
//! sanitizer-finding bookkeeping recorded alongside it.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! `docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` §6/A6 asks for an *ordered*
//! `Vec<ToolEvent { primitive, origin, seq }>`. Here, ordering is the
//! `Vec<ToolEvent>`'s own push order (guaranteed by
//! [`DryRunRecord::record_tool`] appending, never inserting/reordering), and
//! [`DryRunRecord::events_with_seq`] is a derived view that pairs each event
//! with its 0-based position — a computed `seq`, not a stored field.
//!
//! # `primitive: ferrite_core::Primitive`, direct — the B1 fix
//!
//! Prior to this charter, this struct kept `tool: ToolId` (a stringly wire
//! id matching `ferrite_agent::BrowserTool::tool_id()`) plus a best-effort,
//! fallible `ToolEvent::primitive()` bridge to `ferrite_core::Primitive`,
//! because the dry-run executor was itself typed against
//! `ferrite_agent::{BrowserTool, ToolExecutor}` (see `docs/TO-DO.md` T-221).
//! That bridge returned `None` for exactly one case (`"download.file"` vs.
//! `Primitive::Download`'s `"download"` wire string, T-216) and needed a
//! second, comparator-local patch table to close.
//!
//! B1 replaced the dry-run's executor with [`super::engine::DryRunEngine`],
//! which implements [`ferrite_engine::BrowserEngine`] directly — every
//! action is already tagged with its real `ferrite_core::Primitive` via
//! [`ferrite_engine::Call::primitive`], with no second, independently
//! authored string vocabulary to drift out of sync (see that trait's own
//! module docs). So `ToolEvent` now stores the `Primitive` the engine
//! actually recorded, directly: no bridge, no `Option`, no per-case patch
//! table. `ferrite_core::Primitive::JsExecute` is representable here (the
//! *observed* vocabulary always could — see `ferrite_core::taxonomy`'s
//! module docs) even though no *expected*-side type can ever name it; the
//! comparator is what enforces that asymmetry, not this struct.
//!
//! `crate::dataset` (A11's schema) and `ferrite-eval`/`ferrite-ui` construct
//! `ToolEvent` literals directly too — `docs/handoffs/b01.md` documents the
//! exact mechanical fix each of those calls needed (a literal `ToolId::new("dom.read")`
//! becomes `Primitive::DomRead`, etc. — a 1:1 wire-string correspondence, not
//! a redesign).
