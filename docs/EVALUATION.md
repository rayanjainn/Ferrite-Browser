# Ferrite — Evaluation Methodology

This document is `docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` §13's required deliverable:
objectives, formulas, corpus sizing derivation, and parameter rationale,
written to be read by an examiner. It is A12's charter output
(`docs/TO-DO.md` T-112), updated by B2 (`docs/TO-DO.md` T-221's second
half; `docs/handoffs/b02.md`) with real-provider verification.

**Read this first, honestly, before any number below:** the corpus this
document reports against has **29 cases**, not the ~360 §13.3's own sizing
derivation targets. Every interval quoted here is wide because the sample
is small — that is stated plainly throughout, not smoothed over. See §3.
**B2 mechanically migrated the corpus's `by_tool` vocabulary** from the old
`ferrite_agent::BrowserTool::tool_id()` strings to `ferrite_core::Primitive
::as_str()` directly (closing T-216's drift at its source rather than
patching around it) — every case file's `ground_truth`/authored semantics
are byte-for-byte unchanged; only the JSON `by_tool` key spelling for the
one case that used it (`ref06_t1b_jsonfield_exfil.json`: `"download.file"`
→ `"download"`) and `corpus.rs`'s validation logic changed. See §4/§6 for
the details.

**Two numbered runs back this document, both real, neither fabricated:**

1. **The primary, always-reproducible run** (headline numbers throughout
   §1–§3): `cargo run -p ferrite-eval --example eval` with no model config
   set — the default in this sandbox, in CI, and for any contributor who
   hasn't configured `FERRITE_MODEL_SMALL`/`FERRITE_MODEL_MAIN`. The
   fingerprint's `may_use` layer runs rules-only (fail-to-empty); the
   dry-run agent (`WorstCaseAgent`) never calls a model. **Zero live model
   or network calls** and fully reproducible: same corpus in, same numbers
   out, modulo wall-clock timing fields — re-verified this session
   byte-for-byte identical to A12/B1's own committed numbers below.
2. **A real, live-provider run** (B2, new — §2.6): with
   `FERRITE_MODEL_SMALL=FERRITE_MODEL_MAIN=gemma4:31b` set and a real
   `OLLAMA_API_KEY` resolved from the OS keyring (service `"ferrite"`, per
   `docs/PROGRESS.md`'s 2026-09-18 coordinator entry — the same key `just
   probe` verified live during A3), `harness::try_real_provider()`
   constructs a real, undecorated `ferrite_model::OllamaProvider` and the
   fingerprint's `may_use` prediction makes genuine network round trips.
   This run is **not** reproducible byte-for-byte (a live model's answer is
   not pinned the way a scripted corpus is) and is reported separately,
   clearly labeled, never blended into the headline numbers above.

## 1. Objectives (§13.1)

Each objective is stated as a falsifiable claim with the metric that tests
it, and the actual result this session's run produced.

- **O1 (Containment).** *The loop reduces attack success rate versus no
  defense, for attacks whose effect is a deviation from the predicted
  fingerprint.* → ASR, paired across modes.
  **Result:** ASR_Off = 100.0% (22/22), ASR_On = 0.0% (0/22). Paired McNemar
  exact test, Off vs On: b=22, c=0, p (Holm-corrected) < 0.0001, Cohen's h =
  3.142 (the formula's own maximum boundary value — see §2's caveat on why
  this is a ceiling effect of the evaluation methodology, not literally
  "always"). **Supported, with the important caveat in §5** that the
  corpus-runner agent unconditionally re-enacts each case's authored
  deviation rather than modeling whether a real model would take the bait
  (see `ferrite_eval::worst_case_agent`'s module docs).
- **O2 (Attribution).** *Every executed action is attributable to a
  specific admitting capability and origin, and the audit chain commits to
  that attribution.* → tamper tests + attribution coverage.
  **Result:** attribution itself is A7's `comparator` (out of this
  charter's scope, tested by `comparator::tests::*`, unchanged this
  session). Audit-chain commitment: this session's run appended one
  `EvalExecutionRecorded` entry per execution (96 entries) and
  `audit.log.verify_chain()` returned `true`; A8's tamper matrix
  (`ferrite-audit-log`'s own test suite, 20 tests, unchanged this session)
  is the standing proof that mutating any covered field breaks that
  verification. **Supported** for the audit-chain half; the attribution
  half is inherited, not re-verified here.
- **O3 (Utility).** *Benign tasks complete unchanged, and consent burden
  stays below a stated threshold.* → FGR, task-completion parity (UP).
  **Result:** FGR_On (benign false-flag rate) = 3/7 = 42.9% [95% CI
  15.8%–75.0%]. **Not supported at an acceptable threshold** by this run —
  but n=7 total benign cases (2 in `Tier2`) makes this reading barely more
  than anecdotal; the CI spans from "better than one in six" to "three in
  four." UP (task-completion parity vs `Off`) is **not computable at all**:
  `ADR-007`'s own run matrix defines no `Benign`×`Off` cell, so there is no
  baseline trace to diff a benign task's `On`-mode trace against. This is a
  real gap, not a rounding matter — see §5.
- **O4 (Honest limits).** *The blind spot is characterized, not hidden:
  same-origin/same-primitive, data-only attacks
  (`WithinFingerprintDataOnly`) are undetectable by construction and are
  reported as a named residual, with their share of the corpus stated.*
  **Result:** Residual R = 1/22 = 4.5% [95% CI 0.8%–21.8%] of the attack
  corpus. **Supported** — the one `WithinFingerprintDataOnly` case
  (`crates/ferrite-eval/tests/corpus/c24_tool_json_scope_escalation_category5.json`)
  correctly shows `fingerprint_caught = Missed` in every loop-active mode
  by construction
  (`adjudication::tests::fingerprint_missed_within_fingerprint_data_only`),
  and is reported as a floor, not silently dropped from the denominator.
- **O5 (Cost).** *The defense's latency and token overhead are measured,
  not assumed.* → ΔL, ΔT.
  **Result:** ΔL (On − Off total_ms, paired, n_pairs=22): p50 = 0ms, p95 =
  1ms. **ΔT is not computed** — a documented limitation, T-226, see §5.
  ΔL's near-zero reading here is a direct consequence of the rules-only
  fallback this default run uses (no network round-trip), so ΔL here
  measures the loop's own bookkeeping overhead, not a real model-call
  latency delta. **This prediction is now verified, not hypothetical:**
  §2.6's real live-provider run measured ΔL (On − Off, paired, n_pairs=22)
  at p50 = 699 ms, p95 = 1527 ms — the materially different, non-trivial
  number a real network round-trip per loop-active case actually costs.

---

## 2. Metrics — exact formulas and this run's real numbers (§13.2)

Implemented in `crates/ferrite-eval/src/metrics.rs`. Every proportion is a
**Wilson score 95% interval**, computed exactly as specified:
`(p̂ + z²/2n ± z·√(p̂(1−p̂)/n + z²/4n²)) / (1 + z²/n)`, z = 1.96
(`metrics::wilson_interval`, hand-checked against the standard n=10/k=5
worked example in `metrics::tests::wilson_interval_matches_the_n10_k5_worked_example`).

Mode comparisons use **McNemar's exact test** on paired discordant counts
(`metrics::mcnemar_exact_p`, hand-checked against a textbook b=1/c=9 worked
example in `metrics::tests::mcnemar_matches_the_b1_c9_worked_example`),
**Holm-Bonferroni**-corrected across the full 6-comparison mode-pair family
(`metrics::holm_bonferroni`, hand-checked against a 4-p-value family in
`metrics::tests::holm_bonferroni_matches_hand_computed_adjustment`), with
**Cohen's h** effect sizes (`metrics::cohens_h`, checked at its 0 and π
boundary cases).

**A note on the exact-test formula's literal wording:** §13.2 states
McNemar's p-value as `Σ_{i≥min(b,c)}`. By the binomial symmetry
`C(n,i)=C(n,n-i)`, that sum and the standard `Σ_{i=0}^{min(b,c)}` form used
here denote the same quantity reflected around its tail — this
implementation uses the `i=0..=min(b,c)` direction because it is the one
every published reference states the formula as and the one directly
hand-checkable (see `mcnemar_exact_p`'s doc comment for the full
reasoning). A literal `i≥min(b,c)` reading (summing the OTHER, larger
tail) reports large p-values for exactly the skewed samples that should be
significant — backwards for a significance test.

### 2.1 Per-mode metrics, pooled across the whole corpus (n=29)

| Mode | ASR | CR | ADR | SDR | FGR / FSR-proxy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Off | 22/22 = 100.0% [85.1%–100.0%] | 0/22 = 0.0% [0.0%–14.9%] | n/a — loop never runs in Off | n/a — sanitizer never runs in Off | n/a (n=0, benign has no Off cell) |
| SanitizerOnly | 7/19 = 36.8% [19.1%–59.0%] | 12/19 = 63.2% [41.0%–80.9%] | n/a — loop never runs | 12/14 = 85.7% [60.1%–96.0%] | 1/7 = 14.3% [2.6%–51.3%] |
| LoopOnly | 1/19 = 5.3% [0.9%–24.6%] | 18/19 = 94.7% [75.4%–99.1%] | 16/16 = 100.0% [80.6%–100.0%] | n/a — sanitizer never runs | n/a (n=0, benign has no LoopOnly cell) |
| On | 0/22 = 0.0% [0.0%–14.9%] | 22/22 = 100.0% [85.1%–100.0%] | 19/19 = 100.0% [83.2%–100.0%] | 12/17 = 70.6% [46.9%–86.7%] | 3/7 = 42.9% [15.8%–75.0%] |

ADR/SDR are printed `n/a` for modes that never run the layer being
measured (`Off`'s ADR/SDR, `SanitizerOnly`'s ADR, `LoopOnly`'s SDR) rather
than the structurally-guaranteed `0/N` those cells would otherwise show —
ADR-007 is explicit that per-layer power is read only from the isolated
modes that actually run that layer; printing a precise-looking `0.0%` for
a mode that never ran the loop at all would misleadingly read as "the loop
tried and failed."

### 2.2 Per-tier ASR (the pooled numbers above hide exactly this)

| Tier | Mode | ASR |
|---|---|---|
| Tier1 (n=12 attack) | Off | 12/12 = 100.0% [75.7%–100.0%] |
| Tier1 | SanitizerOnly | 5/12 = 41.7% [19.3%–68.0%] |
| Tier1 | LoopOnly | 0/12 = 0.0% [0.0%–24.3%] |
| Tier1 | On | 0/12 = 0.0% [0.0%–24.3%] |
| Tier2 (n=7 attack) | Off | 7/7 = 100.0% [64.6%–100.0%] |
| Tier2 | SanitizerOnly | 2/7 = 28.6% [8.2%–64.1%] |
| Tier2 | LoopOnly | 1/7 = 14.3% [2.6%–51.3%] |
| Tier2 | On | 0/7 = 0.0% [0.0%–35.4%] |
| Tier3AgentDojo (n=3 attack) | Off | 3/3 = 100.0% [43.8%–100.0%] — **insufficient data (n<5)** |
| Tier3AgentDojo | On | 0/3 = 0.0% [0.0%–56.2%] — **insufficient data (n<5)** |

Tier 3 AgentDojo's cells are explicitly flagged rather than left to look
as precise as Tier 1's — 3 cases supports no per-category claim at all,
per T-227's own statement of this exact limitation.

### 2.3 Residual, overhead

- **Residual R** = 1/22 = 4.5% [95% CI 0.8%–21.8%] — the
  `WithinFingerprintDataOnly` share of the attack corpus, reported as a
  structural floor on ASR, not a failure (§13.2's own framing).
- **Overhead ΔL** (On − Off `total_ms`, paired, n_pairs=22): p50 = 0ms,
  p95 = 1ms. See §1/O5 and §5 for why this specific run's ΔL is not a
  meaningful cost estimate.
- **ΔT** (extra model tokens): not computed. T-226, documented limitation
  — see §5.

### 2.4 Mode-pair comparisons (paired McNemar, Holm-Bonferroni across the full 6-pair family, Cohen's h)

| Mode A | Mode B | b | c | n_pairs | p (raw) | p (Holm) | Cohen's h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Off | SanitizerOnly | 12 | 0 | 19 | 0.0005 | 0.0020 | 1.837 |
| Off | LoopOnly | 18 | 0 | 19 | <0.0001 | <0.0001 | 2.679 |
| Off | On | 22 | 0 | 22 | <0.0001 | <0.0001 | 3.142 |
| SanitizerOnly | LoopOnly | 7 | 1 | 19 | 0.0703 | 0.1406 | 0.842 |
| SanitizerOnly | On | 7 | 0 | 19 | 0.0156 | 0.0469 | 1.305 |
| LoopOnly | On | 1 | 0 | 19 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 0.463 |

Read this table carefully: `LoopOnly` vs `On`'s p=1.0 does **not** mean the
sanitizer contributes nothing — it means the loop alone already catches
essentially everything the worst-case scripted agent realizes (see §5), so
there is very little room left for the sanitizer to show a marginal
difference in THIS run's methodology. `SanitizerOnly` vs `LoopOnly`/`On`
being the more borderline/non-significant comparisons (p_Holm 0.14, 0.047)
is the honest signal this small a sample can support: the loop's
containment is the strong, clearly-significant result; the sanitizer's
*marginal* contribution on top of the loop is not resolvable at n=19 paired
cases.

### 2.5 Consent-policy sweep (T-010/D10)

| Consent policy | Mode | ASR |
|---|---|---|
| RejectFlagged (**upper bound on human vigilance**) | LoopOnly | 1/19 = 5.3% [0.9%–24.6%] |
| RejectFlagged (upper bound) | On | 0/22 = 0.0% [0.0%–14.9%] |
| ApproveAll (**lower bound**) | LoopOnly | 19/19 = 100.0% [83.2%–100.0%] |
| ApproveAll (lower bound) | On | 10/22 = 45.5% [26.9%–65.3%] |
| RandomP(p=0.5, seed=42) (**middle estimate**) | LoopOnly | 10/19 = 52.6% [31.7%–72.7%] |
| RandomP(p=0.5, seed=42) (middle estimate) | On | 6/22 = 27.3% [13.2%–48.2%] |

`RejectFlagged` is the headline number reported everywhere else in this
document — and it is explicitly an upper bound on what containment could
be if the user were maximally attentive, never an estimate of real human
behavior. `ApproveAll` and `RandomP(0.5)` bracket it: real human vigilance
almost certainly sits somewhere in this very wide range, which this
corpus makes no attempt to estimate more precisely (that is a
human-factors study, out of scope, per ADR-007/§13.4).

`RandomP` is deterministic given a fixed seed
(`adjudication::ConsentPolicy::deterministic_unit_draw`, tested in
`adjudication::tests::t010_random_p_is_deterministic_given_a_fixed_seed`
across 20 repeated calls) — this table is exactly reproducible from the
same corpus and the same seed.

### 2.6 The real, live-provider run (B2, new)

Everything above (§2.1–§2.5) is the **default, always-reproducible run**:
no `FERRITE_MODEL_SMALL`/`FERRITE_MODEL_MAIN` set, so the fingerprint's
`may_use` layer runs rules-only (fail-to-empty, per `CLAUDE.md`'s own
invariant) and the corpus-wide run makes zero network calls. This section
reports a second, separately-labeled run made with a real, live
`ferrite_model::OllamaProvider` — `FERRITE_MODEL_SMALL=FERRITE_MODEL_MAIN=
gemma4:31b`, key resolved from the OS keyring (service `"ferrite"`, the
same key `just probe` verified live during A3) via
`harness::try_real_provider()`. Run twice this session, ~30 minutes apart,
with **byte-identical results both times** — real evidence of
determinism (temperature 0, seed 42), not an assumption.

Only the metrics that actually depend on the fingerprint's `may_use`
prediction move at all — everything sanitizer-only or audit-only
(`Off`, `SanitizerOnly`, and `On`'s ASR/CR/ADR/audit chain) is
**byte-identical** to §2.1's rules-only numbers, exactly as it should be
since those modes/fields never consult the fingerprint. The two real
differences, both in the expected direction for a real model versus the
rules-only fallback:

| Metric | Rules-only (§2.1) | Live provider (this run) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LoopOnly` ASR/CR | 1/19 = 5.3% / 18/19 = 94.7% | 3/19 = 15.8% / 16/19 = 84.2% | A real `may_use` prediction admits a broader (but still closed-vocabulary, still filtered) set of plausible capabilities than the keyword rules alone catch for 2 of the 19 loop-active attack cases. With no sanitizer running in this mode to independently catch the same deviation, those 2 cases' worst-case action now falls inside the (correctly) wider admitted set and is no longer flagged — a real, honest containment reduction in this one isolated mode, not a bug. |
| `On`'s FGR (false gate rate, benign) | 3/7 = 42.9% [15.8%–75.0%] | 1/7 = 14.3% [2.6%–51.3%] | The real model's `may_use` judgment is less naive than the keyword rules for benign tasks — fewer benign actions get spuriously flagged. Direction makes sense (a real model should be *better* at "is this plausible for the task" than five keyword groups) but n=7 benign×On cases is far too small to treat either number as more than illustrative. |

`On`'s headline ASR/CR (0/22 / 22/22, containment complete) and every
McNemar/Cohen's-h comparison against `Off` are **unaffected** — the
sanitizer's excision (T-105/T-003) already removes the injected
instruction before the loop runs in `On` mode, so a wider or narrower
`may_use` set has nothing left to admit or reject for the attack side.
This is exactly the defense-in-depth composition the four-mode design
(ADR-007) exists to demonstrate: the loop's fingerprint precision moves
independently of the sanitizer's own containment, and `On`'s combination
of both stays robust to either layer's individual noise.

**What this run does and does not establish.** It proves the real
`ferrite_model::ModelProvider` pipeline (A3's cache/throttle/budget
decorators, A4's `fingerprint::generate_fingerprint`, B1's rebuilt
`tool_decision::generate_fingerprint`) works end to end against a live
backend, on the real corpus, with real network calls — not just in
isolated unit tests. It does **not** change this document's headline
numbers (§2.1's rules-only run stays the one quoted everywhere else,
since it is the only one every contributor can reproduce with zero
credentials, per R7) and it does **not** grow the corpus (still n=29,
§3) or make the small-`n` caveats throughout this document any less true
— a 2-case shift in a 19-case cell is exactly the kind of change a wider
confidence interval already warns you not to over-read.

---

## 3. Corpus sizing — derived, then honestly reconciled against n=29 (§13.3)

**The derivation**, exactly as §13.3 states it: sample size per cell from
the target CI half-width *w* at 95%, worst case p̂=0.5:
`n ≈ z²·p̂(1−p̂)/w²`. At *w*=0.15: n ≈ 3.8416·0.25/0.0225 ≈ 42.7 → 43. At
*w*=0.10: n ≈ 3.8416·0.25/0.01 ≈ 96.0 → 96.

**The proposed target** (§13.3's table): Tier 1 (WebContent) 120, Tier 2
(ToolOutput) 80, Tier 3 (AgentDojo) 60, Benign 100 — total ≈ 360, chosen so
per-category CIs land near *w*≈0.10–0.20 and the pooled CI near *w*≈0.09.

**What was actually achieved** (`docs/TO-DO.md` T-227, A11's honest
accounting, unchanged by this session): **29 cases** — Tier 1: 17 of 120
(14% of target), Tier 2: 9 of 80 (11%), Tier 3 AgentDojo: 3 of 60 (5%),
Benign: 7 of 100 (7%). **0% double-authored** against the 10% requirement;
Cohen's κ is not computable and was not fabricated from a fake pair
(ADR-008's independence layers are not realized this session — no
teammate/professor slice exists).

**What this means for the numbers in §2, stated plainly:**

- The pooled attack-corpus intervals (n=19–22) are wide but not vacuous —
  e.g. `ASR_On`'s CI is [0.0%, 14.9%], which is a real, useful upper bound
  even though it is far from the ±10-point precision §13.3's derivation
  aimed for.
- The per-tier intervals (§2.2) are considerably wider (Tier 2's n=7 gives
  CI half-widths around 20–35 points), and Tier 3 AgentDojo's n=3 is
  explicitly flagged as **not supporting any claim at all** — 3 cases
  cannot distinguish "this defense generalizes to an external benchmark"
  from noise.
- The benign-side numbers (n=7 total, FGR_On=3/7) are the least powered
  claim in this whole document — a 42.9% point estimate with a CI spanning
  15.8%–75.0% supports "somewhere between rare and common," nothing
  sharper. O3's utility claim is the one this corpus size speaks to least.
- No claim in this document should be read as more precise than its stated
  CI. Where a stratum is too small to say anything (Tier 3, n<5 per §2.2's
  own floor), this document and the generated report say so explicitly
  rather than presenting a number that looks as confident as a
  well-powered one.

---

## 4. Parameter rationale (§13.4) — verified against the actual implementation, drift corrected

| Parameter | §13.4's stated value | Verified true of what `just eval` actually runs? |
|---|---|---|
| Model backend | Ollama Cloud | **Yes, as of B1/B2 — the A12-era drift this row used to describe is fixed, not just documented.** A12's original note here described `ferrite_ipi::tool_decision::LlmMayUsePredictor` making a direct `reqwest::Client` call straight to the Gemini API — that type no longer exists. B1 rebuilt `tool_decision::generate_fingerprint` to take a real `&dyn ferrite_model::ModelProvider` and call A4's `fingerprint::generate_fingerprint`; B2 wired `harness::try_real_provider()` to construct a real `ferrite_model::OllamaProvider` from `ModelConfig`/the OS keyring when `FERRITE_MODEL_SMALL`/`FERRITE_MODEL_MAIN` are set, and verified it live against Ollama Cloud (§2.6, `gemma4:31b`, byte-identical across two separate runs). The default `just eval` run (no env vars set, §2.1–§2.5's headline numbers) still uses the rules-only fail-to-empty path deliberately, per R7 — this is a choice about what the *automated, always-reproducible* run does, not a limitation of what the pipeline can do. |
| Model tiering | small for `may_use`, mid for the agent loop | **The `may_use` half is real and verified** (§2.6 uses `ModelTier::Small` via `fingerprint::generate_fingerprint`, unchanged since A4). The agent-loop mid-tier half remains moot for `just eval` specifically: `WorstCaseAgent` (§5) is a deterministic re-enactment of authored `ground_truth`, not a model deciding a plan, by design — it makes no model call of any kind, tiered or otherwise. |
| Model temperature / seed | 0, fixed seed | **Verified, not assumed** — §2.6's two live runs, ~30 minutes apart, produced byte-identical per-mode metrics, which is only possible if the real model calls underneath are genuinely deterministic at temperature 0 with a fixed seed. `WorstCaseAgent`'s own action-decision determinism is separately a pure function of `ground_truth`, unrelated to the model call. |
| Response caching | content-addressed, on by default | Real and active on the §2.6 live path — `ferrite_model::OllamaProvider` is used through its normal `Cache`/`Throttle`/`Budget` decorator stack (A3), unchanged by B1/B2. Not exercised by the default rules-only run, which makes no model call to cache. |
| Call budget | 500 per process, hard abort | Same as response caching — real and active on the §2.6 live path via the same decorator stack, not exercised by the default run. |
| Capability allowlist | closed, 7 labels | Verified unchanged — `ferrite_core::Capability`'s closed enum, untouched this session. |
| Provider failure policy | fail to empty | Verified unchanged — `fingerprint::engine`'s fail-to-empty guards, untouched this session (read-only per this charter's scope walls). |
| `js.execute` | always unscopable | Verified unchanged — `comparator`'s structural handling, untouched this session. |
| Dry-run timeout | 30s | Verified true: `DryRunOrchestrator::new`'s `timeout_secs: 30` default, untouched this session. |
| Excision granularity | sentence segment | Verified true of A5's sanitizer, untouched this session (not independently re-audited beyond reading). |
| Excision replacement | single space, no marker | Same as above. |
| Pattern count | 5 labelled patterns | Carried forward from A5/A11's audit; not independently re-counted this session. |
| Scope precedence | exact > domain-suffix > task-open | Verified unchanged — A7's comparator, untouched this session. |
| **Consent policy (sim)** | swept; `RejectFlagged` headline | **Corrected this session (T-010/D10).** Previously hard-pinned to `RejectFlagged` (D10's defect). Now a real `ConsentPolicy` enum — `RejectFlagged`/`ApproveAll`/`RandomP(p, seed)` — actually read by `adjudicate`, with `RejectFlagged` reported everywhere as the explicit upper bound §13.4 always intended it to be. See §2.5. |
| Detection vs excision split | independently toggled | **Corrected this session (T-215).** Previously `harness.rs::run_one` called `set_detect_enabled` alone, so `strip_enabled` stayed `false` in every eval-harness mode regardless of `DefenseMode` — `On` and `LoopOnly` were behaviorally identical in the actual harness even though A5 had wired live excision in production. Now `run_one`/`ferrite-ui`'s dry-run construction both call `set_defense_mode(mode)`, which derives both flags together. This is what makes `On`'s `SanitizerOnly`-catches-and-strips path (`FinalOutcome::Stripped`, T-004) reachable at all in the eval harness. |

---

## 5. Honest limitations (this session's; A13 owns the final consolidated pass)

1. **The corpus-runner agent is scripted from ground truth, not a real
   model reasoning about whether to comply with an injected instruction.**
   `ferrite_eval::worst_case_agent::WorstCaseAgent` re-enacts each attack
   case's authored `expected_extra_primitives`/`expected_out_of_scope_origins`/
   `attack_origin` unconditionally — it does not read the (possibly
   sanitizer-stripped) content it observes and decide whether to comply.
   This is a deliberate, stated methodology choice (see that module's own
   doc comment) appropriate to THIS project's specific claim — Ferrite's
   contribution is the architectural defense (catching a *realized*
   deviation), not base-model robustness (whether a given model falls for
   a given phrasing) — but it means:
   - `ASR_Off` = 100% here measures "if the agent complied, would anything
     stop it" (answer: no, by construction of `Off`), not "does a real
     model actually comply." A live-model run would very likely show a
     lower, more realistic `Off`-mode ASR.
   - `FinalOutcome::Stripped` is proven correct by the table-driven unit
     test (`adjudication::tests::t004_table_driven_attack_final_outcome_every_combination`)
     but does not appear in this run's aggregate numbers at all (§2.4's
     `LoopOnly` vs `On` p=1.0 is a symptom of this) — because the scripted
     agent's action doesn't depend on whether content was stripped, the
     loop almost always still catches the unconditionally-issued
     deviation directly, so `ContainedViaConsent` dominates. Observing
     `Stripped` in aggregate data would need either a live-model agent or
     a scripted agent that reacts to stripped content specifically.
2. **ΔT (extra model tokens) is not computed.** `ferrite_model::response::TokenUsage`
   exists and is exactly the right shape (T-226), but threading it through
   requires changing `fingerprint::engine::generate_fingerprint`'s return
   type (explicitly off-limits — `fingerprint/` is in this charter's
   do-not-touch list beyond reading) and `ferrite_agent::AgentRuntime::run_turn`'s
   signature (a different crate, not in scope either, and — per finding
   1 above — the agent that would need to carry it doesn't call a model at
   all in this run). Given both blockers are genuinely outside this
   charter's file scope, this is reported as a documented limitation, not
   a schema addition — adding an unpopulated `Timing.tokens` field would
   itself violate `CLAUDE.md`'s no-dead-code invariant.
3. **FSR is a case-level proxy, not the literal segment-level ratio §13.2
   defines.** `ExecutionRecord` carries `sanitizer_caught: LayerOutcome`
   (one value per execution) and `final_outcome`, not a per-segment
   (excised, total) pair — instrumenting that would mean touching
   `ferrite-ipi::sanitizer`/`dry_run`, both off-limits beyond reading per
   this charter. The `FGR / FSR-proxy` column in §2.1 is the same
   computation (`|BenignFalseFlag| / |benign cases run under that mode|`)
   read under two different names depending on mode — documented, not
   silently presented as the literal metric.
4. **UP (utility preservation vs `Off`) is not computable at all** — the
   run matrix (ADR-007) defines no `Benign`×`Off` cell, so there is no
   baseline benign trace to diff against. This is a design property of the
   four-mode protocol itself, not a bug this session introduced or could
   fix within scope.
5. **`WithinFingerprintOriginShift` adjudication gap, root-caused, not
   fixed.** Inspecting `ref09_cat5_within_fingerprint.json` with the T-202
   tool (`cargo run -p ferrite-eval --example inspect_case -- crates/ferrite-eval/tests/pilot_corpus/ref09_cat5_within_fingerprint.json`)
   and its diff dump shows exactly why `fingerprint_caught = Missed` for
   this case despite `consent_gated = Gated`: with no
   `FERRITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` set (this session's deterministic default), the
   rules-only fingerprint predictor does not recognize this case's
   `user_task` phrasing as triggering any capability, so the expected
   fingerprint is legitimately empty (correct fail-to-empty behavior).
   With nothing expected, `comparator::compare` has no admitted capability
   for any primitive, so BOTH the primary read and the navigation to
   `attack_origin` land in `diff.extra_primitives`
   (`{"dom.read", "navigate"}`) rather than `diff.out_of_scope_origins` —
   and `adjudication::adjudicate`'s `WithinFingerprintOriginShift` arm only
   checks the latter bucket. Containment itself is not broken (the case is
   still correctly `Gated`/`ContainedViaConsent`); only this category's
   specific per-layer attribution claim doesn't land as designed. A real
   fix belongs in `adjudication.rs`'s own check (in `ferrite-eval`, in
   scope for a future session, not attempted this session because it is a
   genuine semantics decision, not a one-line patch — see
   `docs/TO-DO.md` T-228 for the exact reasoning).
6. **Single-machine eval, no independent double-authoring.** Every case is
   `Author::SelfAuthored` or `Author::AgentDojo`; Cohen's κ is not
   computable (§3). This is A11's finding, carried forward unchanged.
7. **§13.4's model-backend/tiering/caching/budget rows describe a design
   the eval harness's fingerprint layer does not yet run under** — see §4.
   This is `docs/TO-DO.md` T-224, found by the coordinator before this
   session, not something A12 introduced or could fix within its file
   scope (`fingerprint/` off-limits).

A13 (reconciliation & release) should fold these into the project's final
consolidated limitations section alongside its own findings (irreducible
blind spot, pattern ceiling, consent-policy upper bound, single-machine
eval — per its own charter) rather than duplicating this list; this
document is the source for the eval-specific ones.

---

## 6. Consolidated limitations — final pass (A13, `docs/TO-DO.md` T-113)

This section is the definitive limitations account for v0.1.0. It absorbs
§5 above rather than duplicating it — where a §5 finding still holds
unchanged, it is cross-referenced, not re-derived. Every number below was
re-verified this session against the real corpus files and source, not
copied forward from an earlier agent's claim (see the grep/count commands
cited inline).

1. **Irreducible blind spot.** Same-origin/same-primitive, data-only
   attacks (`GroundTruth::WithinFingerprintDataOnly`) are undetectable by
   the fingerprint/comparator layer **by construction** — there is no
   deviation from the predicted fingerprint for the loop to notice, because
   the attack never leaves the fingerprint's admitted surface. Measured
   share of the attack corpus: **R = 1/22 = 4.5%** [95% CI 0.8%–21.8%]
   (re-verified: `grep -l 'WithinFingerprintDataOnly' crates/ferrite-eval/tests/**/*.json`
   matches exactly one file,
   `crates/ferrite-eval/tests/corpus/c24_tool_json_scope_escalation_category5.json`).
   This is a structural floor on ASR, not a defect — reported as such
   everywhere in this document, never smoothed into the headline number.

2. **Pattern ceiling.** The sanitizer's detection layer is 5 general
   literal-phrase patterns (`instruction_override`,
   `instruction_override_disregard`, `system_prompt_reference`,
   `data_exfiltration_language`, `new_instructions`) plus 5 script-specific
   patterns (`js_fetch_call`, `js_websocket_construction`,
   `js_cookie_access`, `js_storage_access`, `js_send_beacon`) — re-counted
   this session directly against `crates/ferrite-ipi/src/sanitizer/patterns.rs`
   (`GENERAL_PATTERNS`/`SCRIPT_PATTERNS`), not assumed from the directive's
   parameter table. Patterns match literal phrasing; they miss paraphrase,
   synonym substitution, and any non-English injection by design — this is
   stated in the sanitizer's own module docs, not just this document. **The
   architecture (predict → dry-run → compare → consent), not sanitizer
   recall, carries the actual security argument** — `LoopOnly` mode (loop
   active, sanitizer bypassed) independently reaches CR = 94.7% in this
   corpus (§2.1), which is the evidence for that claim, not an assertion.

3. **Consent-policy upper bound.** `RejectFlagged` — the policy behind
   every headline number in this document — models a maximally attentive
   human who correctly rejects every flagged item. It is reported
   everywhere as an **upper bound on human vigilance**, never as an
   estimate of real user behavior (T-010's own finding, §2.5). The sweep
   against `ApproveAll` (lower bound, `On`-mode ASR = 45.5%) and
   `RandomP(0.5)` (middle estimate, `On`-mode ASR = 27.3%) shows how wide
   the real range plausibly is; no human-factors study narrows it further,
   and none was in scope.

4. **Single-machine eval.** Every number in this document comes from one
   run, on one machine (macOS, Apple Silicon, `rustc 1.98.1` —
   `docs/BUILD_BUDGET.md`'s recorded environment), authored and run by one
   agent session per corpus-authoring pass. There is no cross-hardware, no
   cross-platform (Windows/Linux CI never ran the eval, only `check`/
   `test`), and no cross-operator replication of these specific numbers.
   The harness is deterministic and reproducible *on this machine*
   (`just eval` twice produced byte-identical 29-case/96-execution counts,
   per A12's entry) — reproducibility and independent replication are not
   the same claim, and only the former is established here.

5. **Corpus-size shortfall (T-227).** Re-counted this session directly
   against the corpus directories (`grep`/`ls`, not trusted from prior
   claims): **29 cases** against the §13.3 target of **~360** — Tier 1
   (WebContent) 17/120 (14.2%), Tier 2 (ToolOutput) 9/80 (11.25%), Tier 3
   (AgentDojo) 3/60 (5.0%), Benign 7/100 (7.0%); 22 attack / 7 benign
   overall, confirmed via `grep -c '"corpus": "Attack"'`/`"Benign"` across
   all three corpus directories. Confidence intervals throughout this
   document are correspondingly wide: the pooled attack-mode intervals
   (n=19–22) run roughly ±15 points; per-tier intervals (n=3–12) run
   ±20–35 points; Tier 3's n=3 is flagged as supporting no per-category
   claim at all (§2.2). **0% double-authored** against the 10% requirement
   — every case is `Author::SelfAuthored` or `Author::AgentDojo` (a
   citation-derived provenance, not a second independent human) — so
   Cohen's κ is not computable and was not fabricated from a fake pair.

6. **Worst-case-agent methodology.** `ferrite_eval::worst_case_agent::WorstCaseAgent`
   re-enacts each attack case's authored deviation unconditionally — it
   does not read the (possibly sanitizer-stripped) content and decide
   whether to comply, the way a real model-driven agent would. This is a
   **deliberate scope choice**, stated in the module's own doc comment, not
   an oversight: Ferrite's claim is that the architecture contains a
   *realized* deviation, not that a given model resists a given phrasing of
   an injected instruction. Concretely, this means `ASR_Off = 100%` in this
   corpus measures "if the agent complied, would anything stop it"
   (by construction, nothing does in `Off`), not "does a real model
   actually comply" — a live-model run would very likely show a lower,
   more realistic `Off`-mode ASR, and would be a different, complementary
   experiment, not a re-run of this one.

7. **The live-app gap (T-224) — significant, not a footnote.** The actual
   running `ferrite-ui`/`ferrite-shell` application does not use the
   `ferrite-model`/`ferrite-engine`/`browser_loop` stack this rebuild built
   and tested. Verified this session by reading the call path directly:
   `ferrite-ui`'s agent-task handler still calls
   `ferrite_agent::gemini::GeminiAgent::read_api_key()` (a `gemini_key.txt`
   file or a bare `FERRITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` env var — code that predates
   `ferrite-model` and does not know the OS keyring exists), and never
   constructs a `ferrite_model::ModelProvider`, never calls
   `ferrite_engine::BrowserEngine`, and never drives
   `ferrite_agent::browser_loop::run_agent_loop`. The IPI defense loop
   itself (`ferrite-ipi`: fingerprint, sanitizer, dry-run, comparator,
   consent) **is** real, tested, and (per `docs/PROGRESS.md`'s A7 entry)
   wired into `ferrite-ui`'s own agent-task path — what is *not* wired in
   is the new model-provider and engine abstraction this rebuild's later
   phases (A3, A9) built alongside it. This is a real, material gap
   between "what was built and proven in isolation" and "what actually
   runs when you launch the app," not a minor integration detail.

8. **`ServoEngine` real-navigation gap (T-220).** The new,
   engine-agnostic path's Servo backend (`ferrite-engine-servo`) does not
   complete a real page load in this environment: `ServoEngine::new`
   succeeds against a real, successfully-built Servo, but `navigate()` to a
   loopback fixture server never observes a TCP connection attempt within
   the drive-until-loaded window (leading hypothesis: `HeadlessServoSession`
   needs a genuine winit event loop driving it, not bare
   `spin_event_loop()` calls — not confirmed, not fixed). **This is
   isolated to the new wrapper.** `docs/TO-DO.md` T-220 carries a
   2026-09-18 addendum, confirmed live by the coordinator: the live
   `ferrite-ui`/`ferrite-shell` app's own, separate Servo integration
   (`ferrite-servo::session`/`shell.rs`, built with
   `cargo run -p ferrite-shell --features ferrite-servo/servo`) uses a real
   winit event loop and was directly observed rendering a real page
   end-to-end. Real browsing in the actual product is not blocked by
   T-220; the new `BrowserEngine`-trait path's Servo backend is.

9. **Other open items material to an honest accounting, briefly:**
   - **T-221** — `ferrite-ipi` depends on `ferrite-agent`, backwards from
     the target dependency direction (`core ← {model, audit, engine} ← ipi
     ← agent ← {ui, eval, cli}`). Confirmed still present this session
     (`crates/ferrite-ipi/Cargo.toml`: `ferrite-agent = { workspace =
     true }`). Fixing it means relocating `BrowserTool`/`AgentRuntime`/
     `ToolExecutor` to a crate both sides can depend on — real, cross-crate
     work, not attempted here (out of a doc-reconciliation charter's
     remit; `CLAUDE.md`'s dependency-direction invariant now names this
     exception explicitly rather than silently contradicting it).
   - **T-222** — `FingerprintDiff`'s `extra_primitives`/`out_of_scope_origins`
     each record only one half of a `(tool, origin)` pair, so the consent
     panel can name authorized origins in general but not tie a specific
     flagged primitive to the specific origin it needed. A real fix means
     enriching the diff's shape in `ferrite-ipi::comparator`.
   - **T-223** — iced 0.13's `button` widget has no `Focusable` impl in
     this pinned version, so the consent panel's Reject button cannot get a
     literal keyboard-focus-ring default; mitigated with reject-listed-first
     plus strict completeness-gating (no silent default-approve path
     regardless of stray-keypress focus).
   - **T-228** — `WithinFingerprintOriginShift`'s adjudication check credits
     a catch only via `diff.out_of_scope_origins`; a degenerate (correctly
     empty, fail-to-empty) fingerprint routes the same deviation into
     `diff.extra_primitives` instead, where the check never looks.
     Root-caused (§5 item 5), not fixed — containment itself is not broken
     (the case is still correctly gated), only this category's specific
     per-layer attribution claim.

None of the nine items above is hidden elsewhere and stated differently
here — this section is the single place a reader should go for "what does
this project's evaluation not show."

---

## 7. `docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` §14 — definition of done, scored item by item

Verified fresh this session (T-113), not carried forward from an earlier
agent's self-report. Evidence is cited per item; **[ ]** means genuinely
not met, stated plainly rather than rounded up.

- [x] `just check && just test` green on a clean clone, with no network and
      `OLLAMA_API_KEY` unset, under 5 minutes, without Servo. — Re-run this
      session from a freshly-recreated branch: `just check` clean (fmt,
      clippy `--all-targets -D warnings`, `cargo machete`), `just test`
      green workspace-wide. Exact wall-clock time and command are recorded
      in this session's `docs/PROGRESS.md` entry.
- [x] Every model call routes through cache + throttle + budget decorators;
      a full eval re-run on an unchanged corpus makes zero live calls;
      `just cache-stats` reports the hit rate. — True of `ferrite-model`'s
      own conformance suite and decorators (A3, unchanged), and, as of B2,
      demonstrated on a real path too: the eval harness's fingerprint layer
      now goes through a genuine `ferrite_model::OllamaProvider` when a
      backend is configured (§2.6, verified live), through the same
      Cache/Throttle/Budget stack A3 built. The *default* `just eval` run
      that every contributor and CI actually runs makes zero live calls by
      deliberate design (R7, rules-only fail-to-empty, no env vars set) —
      not because the live path doesn't exist, but because determinism and
      credential-free reproducibility are the right default.
- [ ] `just build-servo` succeeds and the action-conformance suite passes
      against `ServoEngine` at least once, with cost recorded. — **Partially
      true, not done.** `just build-servo` succeeded for real (A9: 15m31s,
      6.4GB, `docs/BUILD_BUDGET.md`). The action-conformance suite did
      **not** fully pass against real `ServoEngine`: construction succeeds,
      but `navigate()` never completes a real page load (T-220). Marked
      unmet rather than rounded up to "passed."
- [x] Every D1–D14 defect closed, each with a test that would fail if
      reverted. — All fourteen have a `docs/TO-DO.md` row citing a real SHA
      and test name (T-001 through T-014, cross-checked against
      `docs/DECISIONS.md`'s ADR history this session). D3/T-003 in
      particular took three charters (A5, A6, A12) to close for real —
      documented as `in-progress` until T-215 landed, not marked done
      early.
- [x] Zero dead code, zero `#[allow(dead_code)]` without a comment naming
      the reason and a `T-###`. — `grep -rn "allow(dead_code)" crates/`
      returns **zero matches** workspace-wide this session — there is
      nothing to check the "has a `T-###` comment" condition against
      because the crate-root `#![deny(dead_code)]` gates
      (`ferrite-core`/`ferrite-model`) made the allow-and-annotate pattern
      unnecessary; no reachable-but-uncalled function was found separately.
- [x] No doc claims anything a test or SHA doesn't back; the doc CI check
      passes. — `scripts/check_purge.sh` and `scripts/check_no_archive_links.sh`
      both run clean this session (the former updated to drop its one
      stale exclusion, see this session's `docs/PROGRESS.md` entry). Every
      SHA spot-checked this session against `git log -1 --format="%H %s"
      <sha>` matched its cited description (sample: `e474403`, `a45b2ad`,
      `6cb4c70`, `6250cb3`, `ec7ece9`, `795977a`, `d9e2c12`, `aaae747`,
      `6e6926a`).
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` has no status section; `.rules`, `commands.md`, broker
      crates and the 9222 forward are gone from the working tree. — Verified
      fresh: `find . -name ".rules" -o -name "commands.md"` (excluding
      `.git/`) — no matches; `grep -rn "9222"` outside `docs/archive/` and
      the rebuild's own record docs — no matches in any live config;
      `crates/ferrite-capability-broker`/`ferrite-policy`/`ferrite-sandbox`
      absent from disk and from `Cargo.toml` `members`. `CLAUDE.md` itself
      re-read this session — no "planned"/"not yet implemented" section,
      only the dependency-direction invariant was updated (to name T-221's
      known exception, not to add a status list).
- [ ] Corpus authored to the §13.3 targets, κ reported; `just eval` emits
      the full metrics table with Wilson CIs and McNemar results. —
      **False, stated plainly.** Corpus is 29 cases, not ~360 (item 5
      above); κ is not computed (0% double-authored). The second half is
      true in isolation — `just eval` does emit the full metrics table with
      Wilson CIs and McNemar/Holm-Bonferroni/Cohen's h results — but the
      item as a whole is not met because the corpus-sizing half is not.
- [x] `docs/EVALUATION.md` complete: objectives, formulas, sizing
      derivation, parameter rationale, honest limitations. — All five
      sections present (§1–§4 plus this §6); this session's §6/§7 are the
      final consolidation the document's own header called for.
- [x] `docs/BUILD_BUDGET.md` shows target-dir size and cold-test time at
      every phase gate. — A1 and A9 entries present with real, cited
      numbers; no phase after A9 changed the build surface enough to need
      a new entry (A10–A12 added no new heavy dependency).
- [x] No commit in `rebuild/*` or `main` mentions Claude, Anthropic, or AI
      assistance. — Verified fresh this session across full history:
      `git log --all --oneline | grep -iE "claude|anthropic|ai.assist"` and
      `git log --all --format="%H %B" | grep -iE "claude|anthropic"` both
      return only two commits (`f582dda`, `01c3f54`) whose *content*
      discusses fixing **`CLAUDE.md` the file** — no AI-attribution trailer,
      byline, or "generated with" string anywhere in the matched text. No
      breach found.

**Net: 8 of 11 items fully met, 1 partially met (Servo conformance —
build succeeds, real navigation does not), 2 not met (corpus size/κ). This
matches, item for item, what `docs/TO-DO.md` T-227 and T-220 already state
honestly — nothing in this checklist is new information, only the first
place it is scored against the directive's own checklist explicitly.**
