# Ferrite — Architecture Decision Records

Numbered, dated, append-only. Extracted from `FINALIZED_DECISIONS.md` and
`EVALUATION_PLAN.md` (both now under `docs/archive/`, see the banner on each
for why they're not live references) by Agent A0, per
`docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md` §6/A0. Only decisions still believed true are
here — anything superseded by the rebuild (the D1–D14 defect list) says so
inline rather than being silently dropped.

Each entry cites the commit SHA where the decision's implementation actually
landed in the pre-rebuild codebase, per R2 (no status claim without proof).

## ADR-000 — Architectural defense over model-level defense

**Date:** project inception, reaffirmed throughout. **Status:** live, unchanged by the rebuild.

Prompt injection is not treated as solvable by better model training — the
labs building the models say as much themselves. Ferrite instead constrains
*what an agent is allowed to do* and makes deviation visible and
consent-gated, so a successful injection has a bounded blast radius
regardless of what the malicious text says. Mechanism: **predict → dry-run →
compare → consent.**

1. **Predict** the task's expected fingerprint (must-use + may-use tools/origins).
2. **Dry-run** the agent's plan against synthetic data, no real network reachable.
3. **Compare** actual (dry-run) behavior against the predicted fingerprint.
4. **Consent-gate** any deviation before the real run proceeds.

This is the one decision every later ADR and every A1–A13 charter serves.
Nothing in the rebuild changes it — the rebuild fixes how faithfully the
mechanism is implemented (D1–D14), not the mechanism itself.

## ADR-001 — Capability = (action class × origin scope)

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03). **Status:** live, carried into directive §8 verbatim.

A capability is not a fake domain tool ("email.read" doesn't exist as
something the agent can do) — it's an **action class** (a grouping of
primitives sharing a security character: `read`, `interact`, `navigate`,
`download`, `clipboard`, `execute`) paired with an **origin scope** (where
it's authorized to act). "Email" is a property of the origin scope, authored
per task, never a tool the model can invent. Closed capability vocabulary:
`web.read`, `web.navigate`, `web.interact`, `web.download`, `scoped.read`,
`clipboard.read`, `clipboard.write`.

This eliminated a real historical bug: the rule engine and LLM predictor
used to emit tool IDs (`email.read`, `calendar.write`, `network.fetch`,
`report.write`, `contacts.read`, `storage.*`, `screenshot`, `form.submit`)
that no `BrowserTool` variant could ever realize — a vocabulary mismatch
between what the fingerprint claimed and what the dry-run could actually
record. All of those are permanently cut from the vocabulary, not
re-added under the rebuild.

**Carries forward with an expanded primitive set.** The original 8
primitives (`navigate`, `dom.read`, `dom.write`, `form.fill`,
`clipboard.read`, `clipboard.write`, `js.execute`, `download.file`) become a
larger set under the rebuilt `BrowserEngine` action surface (directive §8:
adds `dom.query`, `click`, `scroll`, `wait`, `tab.open`, `tab.close`,
`cookie.read`, `storage.read`, `screenshot`). The action-class × origin-scope
*model* is unchanged; the lowering table just gets more rows. A2/A4 own
updating the table; the exhaustiveness test requirement (directive §8) is
new discipline, not a decision reversal.

## ADR-002 — Closed attack-technique vocabulary for corpus authoring

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03). **Status:** live, unchanged, feeds A11.

Two orthogonal, closed, multi-valued tag groups so two authors tag a case
identically:
- **Rhetorical** (what the injected text argues): `instruction_override`,
  `context_manipulation`, `social_engineering`, `goal_hijack`.
- **Concealment** (how the payload is hidden): `obfuscation`,
  `payload_splitting`, `plain`.

Every attack case carries ≥1 tag. Orthogonal to `carrier_vector` (ADR-006),
which is the *structural location*, not the rhetorical/concealment method.
No free text — closed vocabulary lives here, in one place, so it can't drift.

## ADR-003 — `js.execute` is unconditionally unscopable

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03). **Status:** live, strengthened by the rebuild (D1/D2, A7).

`js.execute` can synthesize any other primitive invisibly past the
`ToolExecutor` boundary, so it can never be part of any capability's
expected realization, at any scope, ever. The comparator's rule is general
(*any primitive whose action class is unscopable is unconditionally a
deviation*), not a `js.execute` string special-case — the property lives on
the action class definition, not buried in comparator logic.

**Rebuild strengthens the encoding.** Pre-rebuild this was a runtime check
(`const UNSCOPABLE: &[&str] = &["js.execute"]` in `comparator.rs`). Directive
§8/A4 requires it be structurally unrepresentable — a separate
`ExpectedCapability` enum that simply has no variant capable of producing it
— so the invariant is enforced at compile time, not by remembering to check
a list at runtime. The decision (unscopable, always deviation, always
consent-gated) is unchanged; only the enforcement mechanism gets stronger.

## ADR-004 — Origin scope is authored, typed, and precedence-ordered

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03). **Status:** live; implementation gap identified and scheduled for A7 (D1/D2).

`expected_origins` is authored per case as a typed scope, not a flat
allowlist, because a flat list either over-restricts (false positives on
legitimate result pages) or gets padded so wide it admits the attack:
- `exact` — specific known origins (tightest).
- `domain_suffix` — a bounded family (`*.wikipedia.org`).
- `task_open` — genuinely open browsing, requires a written rationale,
  flagged weak-scope for stratified reporting.

Specificity precedence for attribution: `exact` > `domain_suffix` >
`task_open`. Containment is reported **stratified by scope tightness** —
turning the "open-web scope is a soft spot" problem into a measured,
disclosed gradient instead of a hidden weakness.

**Known implementation gap, not a decision reversal:** the pre-rebuild
`compare()` took exactly one `OriginScope` for the *entire task*, so a
fingerprint mixing a narrow `scoped.read` and a wide `web.read` had no way
to give each its own scope — `admission_rank()`'s specificity math was
computed and never consumed. This is D1/D2 in the defect register; A7's job
is to make the comparator take **per-capability** scopes so this decision is
actually expressible, not just documented.

## ADR-005 — Two-layer dataset schema: CaseDefinition + ExecutionRecord

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03), field set finalized same commit. **Status:** live, carried into A11.

A case is authored once (`CaseDefinition` — corpus, tier, author, carrier,
carrier_vector, attack_category, attack_techniques, `in_scope`, user_task,
expected_origins, ground_truth, ...) and run many times (`ExecutionRecord` —
one row per case × defense-mode, carrying the fingerprint used, the actual
event log, the computed diff, per-layer catch outcomes, final outcome,
timing, audit anchor). Every M1–M6-class metric is a filter/aggregate over
these two structs; a metric needing a field that's absent means re-running
experiments, hence pinning the schema before building the harness.

**Derived, never stored:** `unscopable_primitive_invoked` (pure function of
`extra_primitives`), `production_residual` (pure function of
`fingerprint_caught` + `consent_gated`). Storing either risks divergence
from the fields they're computed from — a general principle the rebuild
keeps (directive's metrics module, A12, computes these at query time too).

## ADR-006 — `carrier_vector` closed vocabulary + `GroundTruth` as a tagged enum

**Date:** design fixed by commit `65b6d67` (2026-08-25). **Status:** live; partition-enforcement gap identified and scheduled for A11 (D6).

`carrier_vector` records *where structurally* the payload rides, partitioned
by which carrier the case declares:
- `WebContent` (T1a): `hidden_element`, `offscreen_text`, `html_comment`,
  `alt_text`, `meta_content`, `css_pseudo`, `visible_text`.
- `ToolOutput` (T1b): `tool_json_field`, `tool_text_blob`,
  `tool_error_message`, `tool_metadata`.

`GroundTruth` is a four-variant tagged enum, not a flat struct with mostly-
null fields, because the shapes genuinely differ: `Deviation` (categories
1–4: primitive/origin the legit task didn't authorize), `WithinFingerprintOriginShift`
(category 5, origin-distinguishable — caught by per-origin attribution),
`WithinFingerprintDataOnly` (category 5, same-origin/same-primitive/data-only
— the irreducible residual, always `Missed` by the fingerprint layer by
construction), `None` (benign).

**Known implementation gap, not a decision reversal:** pre-rebuild, the
carrier/carrier_vector partition match was validated only at JSON-corpus-load
time (`corpus.rs::partition_matches`); a hand-built Rust `CaseDefinition`
literal could still violate it. D6 in the defect register; A11 moves this
into the type system (sealed constructor or carrier-specific enums) so it's
unrepresentable, not just checked.

## ADR-007 — Four-mode baseline protocol (Off / On / SanitizerOnly / LoopOnly), per-layer power read only from isolated modes

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03, base 3-mode toggle); `LoopOnly` added same commit once the four-condition measurement design was settled. **Status:** live, carried into directive §13 headline metrics.

A defense number is meaningless without a baseline. Four committed
conditions, not one:
- **Off** — agent runs directly; measures whether the attack is real (M2/ASR baseline).
- **On** — full composed stack; the deployed-system number.
- **SanitizerOnly** — filter alone, loop bypassed; the filter's standalone power (M1a).
- **LoopOnly** — sanitizer bypassed, loop runs on raw content; the
  architecture's standalone power with content detection explicitly off —
  the cleanest evidence containment comes from architecture, not passive
  stripping (RQ1's most direct evidence).

**Per-layer power is read from the isolated modes, never from On** — in On
the sanitizer strips first, so the loop only ever sees what upstream missed,
which understates each layer if read as a standalone number. The two
deltas — `M1 − M1_loop` (sanitizer's marginal contribution) and `M1 − M1a`
(architecture's marginal contribution beyond passive stripping) — are
first-class reported results, not an afterthought.

**Known implementation gap, not a decision reversal:** pre-rebuild,
`adjudicate()`'s On-mode `final_outcome` ignored `sanitizer_caught` entirely
— once excision activates, a successfully-stripped attack would report as
`Executed` (attack succeeded), inverting the headline metric. D4 in the
defect register; A12 fixes the outcome lattice.

## ADR-008 — Credibility strategy: three independence layers + two structural safeguards

**Date:** design fixed by commit `46b2177` (2026-07-03). **Status:** live, unchanged, feeds A11 corpus construction.

Self-authored attacks + self-built defense is circular by default — a
reviewer can dismiss the result as graded homework. Three independence
layers, ordered by strength: (1) a teammate who didn't build the defense
authors a held-out slice; (2) an external professor slice, treated as
planned upside, not load-bearing (the plan must stand without it); (3) an
adapted external-benchmark slice (AgentDojo, Slack suite only — the one
suite whose threat model maps to a browser-tool surface without fabricating
capabilities).

Two hard rules make the independence real rather than decorative:
- **Held-out firewall** — the defense is tuned only against the
  self-authored set; independent slices run once, at the end, untouched. No
  peeking, no fixing the defense in response to what an independent slice
  exposes mid-development.
- **Briefing boundary** — independent authors get a threat-model brief
  (what the target is, what tools exist) but explicitly **not** a defense
  brief (how the fingerprint loop, sanitizer, or consent gate work). Knowing
  the mechanism unconsciously shapes attacks toward what the mechanism
  catches, degrading the independence the whole exercise exists to buy.

**Note for A11, per the amendment accepted alongside this ADR set:** the 10
existing pilot-corpus cases (`crates/ferrite-eval/tests/pilot_corpus/`) are
real, reusable assets and should seed the real corpus, but they are not
grandfathered in as already-valid: they get re-labelled under the ADR-006
`GroundTruth` enum as it exists post-rebuild, re-validated against the
type-level carrier partition (D6), and count toward the 10%
double-authoring / Cohen's κ ≥ 0.8 requirement in directive §13.3 like any
newly authored case.
