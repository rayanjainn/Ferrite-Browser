# Exclusions, each with a reason — this is a short, explicit allowlist, not
# a way to make the check pass by hiding things:
#   docs/archive/**          — historical, banner-marked, whole point is to name dead things
#   docs/REBUILD_DIRECTIVE.md, docs/AUDIT.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md
#                             — the rebuild's own record; each explicitly discusses what
#                               was removed and why, by name, as its stated job
#   CLAUDE.md                — the "Never reference, import, or revive: ..." list must
#                               name the forbidden crates to forbid them
#   .devcontainer/Dockerfile — its comments explain *why* a target/COPY line is absent;
#                               obscuring the names would make the comment worse, not safer
#   Cargo.lock                — dependency checksums are long hex strings; "9222" and
#                               similar short numeric tokens appear in them by coincidence,
#                               not because a dead dependency is present (verified: no
#                               `regorus`/`extism*` package entries exist in this file)
#   scripts/check_purge.sh itself — its own source necessarily contains the
#                             pattern strings; a self-match here is not a hit
#
# The former exclusion for crates/ferrite-servo/src/shell.rs (a doc-comment
# that used to say "the capability broker") is gone as of A13 (T-113):
# T-207 made this crate cargo-fmt-clean at A1, which was the blocker A0's
# comment cited, so the comment was reworded instead of staying excluded.
